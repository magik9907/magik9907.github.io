  "description": [
    "Data classification tool using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and 4 different metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Czybyshev, Mahalanobis). It allows you to load CSV data and perform preprocessing - normalization, discretization. Additionally, it allows for visualization - a histogram, the location of points on a 2D chart and the assigned class. ",
    "The main goal is to enable the classification of new elements and verify the quality of the classification based on the dataset for different values ​​​​of k.",
    "I was responsible for implementing some functions related to data preprocessing and the kNN algorithm (including testing the classification quality)."
