    "This master's thesis compares approaches using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and clustering algorithms to determine session neighborhoods. The study employs the Vector Multiplication Session-Based kNN (VS-kNN) algorithm, which emphasizes more recent events in session history. Clustering algorithms, specifically K-Means and HDBScan, were integrated with the VS-kNN algorithm. These clustering algorithms were used to group the training set to combine similar sessions and identify patterns in the data. The result of the thesis is a comparison of the performance of these methods in terms of the quality and diversity of recommendations."
